## Experiment: Polynomial Trajectory Generation

In directory [`./PTG`](./PTG), a sample program is provided that tests polynomial trajectory generation. If you input the following command:

```
$ python evaluate_ptg.py
```

you will see an output such as the following figure.

![Example Output of the Polynomial Trajectory Generator][ptg-example]

Note that the above figure is an example, while the result you get will be different from run to run because of the program's random nature. The program generates a number of perturbed goal configurations, computes a jerk minimizing trajectory for each goal position, and then selects the one with the minimum cost as defined by the cost functions and their combination.

Your job in this experiment is:

1. to understand the polynomial trajectory generation by reading the code already implemented and in place; given a start configuration and a goal configuration, the algorithm computes coefficient values for a quintic polynomial that defines the jerk minimizing trajectory; and
2. to derive an appropriate set of weights applied to the cost functions; the mechanism to calculate the cost for a trajectory and selecting one with the minimum cost is the same as described in the previous (Week 6) lecture.

Experiment by tweaking the relative weight for each cost function. It will also be very interesting to define your own cost metric and implement it using the information associated with trajectories.
